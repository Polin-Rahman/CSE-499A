 ### Description :
    Heart failure is defined by the inability of the heart to pump an adequate blood supply to the body. All major body functions are disrupted without sufficient blood flow.Heart failure is now widespread in the world, with this effect facing most individuals. Roughly 48 percent of individuals have heart disease. An unhealthy lifestyle is the main explanation for this situation.It's too expensive and also difficult to cure the disease. The goal of this reserch is to develop a Machine Learning and the Artificial Neural Network based model to predict the risk for heart failure. So that people can anticipate heart attacks sooner and contract with doctors, before triggers arise, also they can take appropriate steps. The key purpose is to compare the accuracy of various algorithms and also the use of artificial neural networks to observe more accurately.
### Algorithms for this proposed model:
   K- Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision tree, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network.
